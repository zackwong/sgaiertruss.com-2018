title: The Features of aluminum alloy grandstand structure
keywords: stage truss
description: Aluminum alloy grandstand structure is portable and easy to stock,today we will introduce some features with you.

<p>1. The material has good corrosion resistance and is maintenance-free for life.</p>
<p>Maintenance free for life (more than 50 years). Under acidic conditions, hydrogen sulfide and mercaptan will not cause damage to this type of aluminum alloy. It is suitable for use in high temperature and high humidity, exposed parts, seaside and heavily polluted environment. It is an ideal choice for green building materials.</p>
<p>2. High material strength and mass ratio, light weight of structure.</p>
<p>At the same strength, the density of the aluminum alloy material is only 1/3 of the density of the steel (the term "steel" is provided by the industry's encyclopedia). At present, the tensile strength of the material has reached 300 MPa. In addition, the structure is a self-supporting system, forming a large-span self-heavy structure. In the structure of the same span type, the aluminum alloy structure is generally 1/3-1/4 of the self-weight of the steel structure.</p>
<p>3. Factory precision, standardization, industrialization.</p>
<p>Standardized factory finishing. Standardization and industrialization of building components have been realized. It has improved the production efficiency of the construction industry in the past and improved social benefits.</p>

<p>4. Metal stand full assembly construction, modular.</p>
<p>All construction parts are standardized and produced on site, and assembled on site. Simplify the construction process and reduce the requirements of construction equipment and site. Increasing the installation speed and reducing the construction period can save about half of the construction time. There is no noise, dust, sewage and other pollution on the construction site, which is a typical green construction.</p>
<p>5. Metal <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">grandstand</a> system integration, modular function.</p>
<p>The entire aluminum alloy <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">grandstand system</a> integrates the main structure, function room, control room, stage, awning, and other functions, and some functions are modularized. It conforms to the global development direction of building modularization, industrialization and standardization, and meets the requirements of green buildings.</p>

<p>6. High metal table material recycling rate.</p>
<p>Metal and aluminum alloy materials are easy to recycle, low in reprocessing cost, high in utilization rate, and high in recycling value. They are completely green materials that are energy-saving and environmentally friendly.</p>
