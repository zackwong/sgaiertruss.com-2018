<p>You should find a <a href="{{ site.url }}/truss/" target="_blank">aluminum truss manufacture</a> not a trading company if you are not the one time buyer or you want a better after sales service.</p>
<p>Check their website if they make many different products,</p>
<p>Usually manufacture focus on certain products because different products need different facilities which will be a big invest and truss manufacture don’t do like that in usual.</p>
<p>Check their address,usually <a href="{{ site.url }}/truss/Lighting-truss/2018-08-22/133.html" target="_blank">truss manufacture</a> not in the city centre or CBD.</p>

<p>3.How to make sure the <a href="{{ site.url }}/truss/" target="_blank">aluminum truss quality</a> is the one you want?</p>
<p>1) Take a trip to their company or check their truss quality on their exhibition booth.</p>
